## Topics to know

1. Positive terms series have increasing partial sums.
2. Positive terms series converge if and only if they are bounded (theorem 1).
3. This is not true for non-positive terms series.
4. Integral test for positive terms series (theorem 2).
5. The harmonic series (example 1).
6. p-series (theorem 3).
