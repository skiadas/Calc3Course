## Topics to know

1. Linearization for functions of two variables, tangent plane. Why is there only one plane equation that makes sense?
2. Definition of a function being differentiable at a point.
3. Example of $f(x, y) = L(x, y) + e(x, y)$ decomposition for $f(x,y) = x^2 + 2x - xy$ at $(0, 0)$. Also try another point, e.g. $(1, 2)$
4. $f$ is differentiable if both $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist and are continuous in a disc around the point of interest.
5. Various ways of writing the linear approximation.
6. Find point on which tangent plane is parallel to a given plane.
