## Problems

- Practice Problems: 14.1 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30

## Topics to know

1. Definition of vector-valued functions.
2. Can think of as a "parametrized path". We have already seen examples in the line equations.
3. Can visualize a path in terms of its projections on the three standard planes. (example 2)
4. Intersection of two surfaces is a curve that we can often parametrize. (example 3)
