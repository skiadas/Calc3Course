## Topics to know

1. Relation between series and sequences
2. Definition of a sequence
3. Basic examples of sequences and their visualizations
4. Sequences defined recursively (Key example: Sequence that approaches root, example 1)
5. Definition of limit of sequence, both intuitive and precise
6. Sequences derived from functions (theorem 1)
7. Geometric sequence (example 6)
8. Limit laws for sequences, squeeze theorem
9. A sequence that absolutely converges to 0 also converges to 0
10. Geometric sequence for negative r (example 8)
11. Using squeeze theorem for convergence of more complicated forms (example 9)
