## Topics to know

1. Definition of a sequence
2. Basic examples of sequences and their visualizations
    - $a_n = 1-\frac{1}{n}$, $a_n = (-1)^n n$
    - Visualize as a graph as well as as points in the plane
3. Sequences defined recursively
    - Newton's method sequence for $\sqrt{2}$
    - $a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a_n}$, $a_1 = 2$
4. Definition of limit of sequence, both intuitive and precise
    - Find the limit of $\frac{n+1}{n+2}$
5. Sequences derived from functions (theorem 1)
    - $\lim_{n\to\infty} n^{1/n}$
6. Geometric sequence for non-negative $r$ (example 6)
7. Limit laws for sequences, squeeze theorem
8. A sequence that absolutely converges to 0 also converges to 0
9. Geometric sequence for negative $r$ (example 8)
10. Using squeeze theorem for convergence of more complicated forms (example 9)
    - $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{R^n}{n!}$
11. Passing a sequence through a function
    - Use for $n^{1/n}$
12. Definition of bounded sequence
13. Convergent sequences are bounded (theorem 5)
14. Bounded monotonic sequences converge (theorem 6)
15. How to use theorem 6 for recursively defined functions:
    - First guess what the limit would be if it existed
    - Show that this limit acts as a bound (proof by induction)
    - Show sequence is increasing/decreasing (proof by induction)
    - Apply for $a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2a_n}$
